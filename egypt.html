    <H2>Ancient Egypt food</H2>

    <img src="./img/egypt/egypt-chapter.jpg" alt="Baking Scene in the tomb of Ramses III, KV11"/>
    <p>
        Since the drawings on the Ramses III tomb did not come with any accompanying writing that may suggest what the
        bread recipe was like, I had to find an ancient recipe, similar to the one depicted on the tomb. The recipe
        resembles the modern recipe of making bagels where the dough is boiled prior to it being baked. In the Middle
        East today there is a common bread sold on open markets in many different countries called Kaak (كعك‎).
        It is usually shaped into a circle shape similar to a bagel, but made much larger. However, the modern versions
        of Kaak are baked straight, without boiling. However, that was not always the case. A 13th century Syrian
        cookbook from Aleppo, Al Wusla ila l-Habeeb, records 3 recipes for Kaak, one of which is first boiled, and
        then baked, just like the bread depicted on Ramses III tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that not all of the loaves depicted on the Ramses III tomb are spiral. Many of them are circular, just
        like Kaak. My guess is that medieval Kaak evolved from this ancient Egyptian bread.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Egyptians would have used sour grape juice, although wine would work as well, to make the bread rise,
        because sour grape juice acts as a leavening agent. There is also a recipe in the anonymous work Geoponica
        (Book 2, Chapter 33) written in the 10th century CE in Constantinople for the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII
        Porphyrogenitus, that suggests to use sour grape juice, squeezed from grapes soaked in water over night,
        instead of yeast to make the bread rise. Since Geoponika collected material from the thousand years prior to
        its writing, it is possible that the recipe is much older than the book itself, possibly being from the Roman
        Empire, which would have included Egypt and other parts of the Middle East.
